[[buffer_aliasing,Buffer Aliasing Extension]] This extension is intended to add more robust support for in-place processing
optimizations in OpenVX through the use of buffer aliasing.
The intended audience for this extension is OpenVX framework vendors,
and user kernel writers.  The APIs added from this extension have no
impact or bearing on the application software (graph creators).


[[sec_background]]
== Background
Before discussing the design for supporting in-place processing in OpenVX, this section defines some
terms and introduces relevant concepts.

[[sec_inplace]]
=== In-Place Processing
Typically, a conventional processing operation reads data from one or more input memory locations, processes it,
and then writes the output to a different memory location.  In this situation,
the contents of the input memory is not changed by the processing operation since it is read and not written to.

In-place processing, however, is a computer science optimization technique wherein the
output of the processing operation overwrites some or all of the input data.  In this case the input
memory may be changed by the processing operation since it is both read and written to.
This approach has some tradeoffs:


.*PROS:*
- Uses less memory than conventional processing approach (since there is no need for a separate output buffer)
- May have faster memory access speeds due to cache benefits of writing to
  cache lines that are already in the cache due to a recent read.

.*CONS:*
- Input is overwritten, so can not be available to other processing operations that may
  have needed it.
- Some software pipelined compilers may have optimization penalties due to loop-carried
  dependencies depending on the order and access pattern of reads and writes of the aliased buffers.

These tradeoffs should be considered when making a decision on whether it is appropriate to use in-place processing. A conservative policy
could be to never use in-place processing since it may always be functionally correct, but it also may leave some performance on the table.
When performance is a high priority, in-place processing could be a useful technique if it is used carefully and done in a way that guarantees
functional correctness.

[[sec_use_cases]]
=== Use Cases
Within the scope of this extension, there are broadly two categories of use cases to consider: dense processing, and sparse processing.

[[sec_dense]]
==== Dense Processing
An example of a dense processing operation could be a pixel-wise NOT operation.  Every pixel in the input image is fetched,
processed with a NOT operation, and then written to the output.  In the context of in-place processing, the entire input image will be overwritten
by the NOT of each input pixel.  Obviously, there is a memory usage benefit from using in-place processing.  However, from a performance improvement perspective, the
NOT operation itself does not benefit from in-place processing other than perhaps a cache access benefit.

[[sec_sparse]]
==== Sparse Processing
An example of a sparse processing operation could be a function which conditionally overwrites only parts of the input based on contents of the input.
In this case, only a sparse subset of data in the input is overwritten (updated) by the operation.  If in-place processing were prohibited, then the function
would first need to copy the entire input buffer to the output before starting the conditional overwrite of this output buffer.  Not using in-place
processing imposes a potentially severe performance penalty of an entire buffer copy.  Or, put the other way, in-place processing brings about a significant performance
improvement by saving a buffer copy operation.

[[sec_compare]]
==== Comparison
Both dense and sparse processing can benefit from the memory savings and the cache performance savings of in-place processing.  However, sparse processing has a significantly
higher performance optimization benefit from the use of in-place processing compared to dense processing.

[[sec_problem]]
=== Limitations in Existing Specification
The current OpenVX spec has limited support for bidirectional parameters.  Currently, only the built-in accumulation kernels use bidirectional parameters.
User kernels are forbidden from using bidirectional parameters.

Bidirectional parameters are problematic when the data object connected to a bidirectional node parameter is attached to more than one node. The graph
scheduler can not ascertain the proper order of operations.

[[page_design]]
= Design Overview
Due to the problematic nature of bidirectional parameters in a graph programming model, this extension takes a different approach: buffer aliasing.

[[sec_aliasing]]
== Buffer Aliasing
Buffer aliasing in the context of OpenVX refers to having multiple data objects internally access the same data buffer in memory.  This aliasing of data buffers
is abstracted from the application by the framework.  As before, the application still creates separate data objects to connect to nodes of the graph, but during graph verification
the graph scheduler can make decisions about aliasing some of the data objects together based on additional information provided from the kernel implementations
using the new API introduced in this extension.  In this way, the application program doesn't need to consider anything from this extension.

[[sec_control]]
== Control Flow
The control flow is straight forward.  This API adds two new functions to be optionally called from user kernel implementations:

.`<<vxAliasParameterIndexHint>>`
   - Notifies framework that the kernel supports buffer aliasing of specified parameters
   - Is called from within the `<<vx_publish_kernels_f>>` callback, for applicable kernels in between the call to the `<<vxAddUserKernel>>`
     function and the `<<vxFinalizeKernel>>` function for the corresponding kernel.

.`<<vxIsParameterAliased>>`
   - Query framework if the specified parameters are aliased
   - Is called from the `<<vx_kernel_initialize_f>>` or `<<vx_kernel_f>>` callback function

The idea is that the kernels can hint about its buffer aliasing capabilities to the framework when they are being loaded into the context.  Then when an application includes the kernel into a graph,
the framework's graph scheduler/optimizer can evaluate if the buffer can be aliased legally at graph verification time.  Then, when
the framework calls the `<<vx_kernel_initialize_f>>` or `<<vx_kernel_f>>` callback of the kernel, the kernel can call `<<vxIsParameterAliased>>` API to understand what decision the framework made,
and process the kernel accordingly.

There may be many situations that arise where buffers can
not be legally aliased due to conflicts between multiple consumers of a buffer which need the original data to not be overwritten.  The framework should have the global knowledge of the
graph to be able to make a decision on whether or not some of the alias hints can be honored or not.  In fact, a framework can be minimally compliant with this extension if it simply implements
a stub for the `<<vxAliasParameterIndexHint>>` API, and returns <<vx_false_e>> for the `<<vxIsParameterAliased>>` API.  That would be consistent with the conservative policy of never allowing buffer aliasing,
while being compatible with user kernels who utilize this extension.

Indicates what type of processing the kernel will perform on the buffer. The framework may use this information to
arbitrate between requests.  For example, if there are two or three conflicting requests for buffer aliasing,
then the framework may choose to prioritize a request which gives a performance improvement as compared with one
that only saves memory but otherwise doesn't give a performance improvement.  For example, a kernel which performs
sparse processing may need to first do a buffer copy before processing if the buffers are not aliased. However a kernel
which performs dense processing will not need to do this.  So priority of the alias request may be given to the
kernel which performs sparse processing.

== Functions

=== vxAliasParameterIndexHint
indexterm:[Buffer Aliasing API, vxAliasParameterIndexHint]
// Brief text:
Notifies framework that the kernel supports buffer aliasing of specified parameters

include::api/protos/vxAliasParameterIndexHint.txt[]

// Detailed text:
This is intended to be called from within the `<<vx_publish_kernels_f>>` callback, for applicable
kernels in between the call to the `<<vxAddUserKernel>>` function and the `<<vxFinalizeKernel>>`
function for the corresponding kernel.

If a kernel can not support buffer aliasing of its parameters (for in-place processing),
then it should not call this function.  However, if a kernel can support buffer aliasing of
a pair of its parameters, then it may call this function with the appropriate parameter indices and
priority value.

Note that calling this function does not guarantee that the buffers will ultimately be aliased by
the framework. The framework may consider this hint as part of performance or memory optimization
logic along with other factors such as graph topology, other competing hints, and if the parameters
are virtual objects or not.

*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _kernel_ - Kernel reference
  * `[in]` _parameter_index_a_ - Index of a kernel parameter to request for aliasing
  * `[in]` _parameter_index_b_ - Index of another kernel parameter to request to alias with parameter_index_a
  * `[in]` _processing_type_ - Indicate the type of processing on this buffer from the kernel. (See `<<vx_buffer_aliasing_processing_type_e>>`)

*Returns:* A `<<vx_status_e>>` enumeration.

*Return Values*

  * `<<VX_SUCCESS,VX_SUCCESS>>` - No errors.
    failure.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE,VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE>>` - kernel is not a valid `<<vx_kernel>>` reference
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS,VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS>>` - _parameter_index_a_ or _parameter_index_b_ is NOT a valid kernel parameter index
  * `<<VX_FAILURE,VX_FAILURE>>` - _processing_type_ is not a supported enumeration value.

// Brief text:
Query framework if the specified parameters are aliased

include::api/protos/vxIsParameterAliased.txt[]


// Detailed text:
This is intended to be called from the `<<vx_kernel_initialize_f>>` or `<<vx_kernel_f>>` callback functions.

If a kernel has called the `<<vxAliasParameterIndexHint>>` function during the vx_publish_kernels_f callback,
then `<<vxIsParameterAliased>>` is the function that can be called in the init or processing function to
query if the framework was able to alias the buffers specified.  Based on this information, the kernel
may execute the kernel differently.


*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _node_ - Node reference
  * `[in]` _parameter_index_a_ - Index of a kernel parameter to query for aliasing
  * `[in]` _parameter_index_b_ - Index of another kernel parameter to query to alias with parameter_index_a

*Returns:* A `<<vx_bool>>` value.

*Return Values*

  * `<<vx_true_e,vx_true_e>>` - The parameters are aliased.
  * `<<vx_false_e,vx_false_e>>` - The parameters are not aliased.
