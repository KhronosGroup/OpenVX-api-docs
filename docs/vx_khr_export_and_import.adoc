= Export and Import Extension to OpenVX 1.1


[[sec_purpose]]
== Purpose

Provide a way of exporting and importing pre-verified graphs or other
objects, in vendor-specific formats.


[[sec_usecases]]
== Use Case

  * Embedded systems using fixed graphs, to minimise the amount of code
    required.
  * Safety-critical systems where the OpenVX library does not have a node
    API.
  * CNN extensions which require the ability to import binary objects.


[[sec_acknowledge]]
== Acknowledgements

This specification would not be possible without the contributions from this
partial list of the following individuals from the Khronos Working Group and
the companies that they represented at the time:

  * Radhakrishna Giduthuri - AMD
  * Frank Brill - Cadence Design Systems
  * Thierry Lepley - Cadence Design Systems
  * Steve Ramm - Imagination Technologies
  * Tomer Schwartz - Intel
  * Jesse Villareal - Texas Instruments


[[page_requirements_requirements]]
= Requirements


[[sec_import]]
== Import and Export of Objects

  * *2.1.1* Application must be able to specify which objects are to be
    exported.
  * *2.1.2* The framework will also export any other objects required; for
    example, if a graph is to be exported then all components of that graph
    will also be exported even if their references were not given.
  * *2.1.3* Upon Import, only those objects that were specified for export
    will be visible in the imported entity; all other objects may be present
    but are not directly accessible.
    For example, a pyramid object may be exported, in which case the levels
    of the pyramid will be available in the usual way.
    As another example, an image that is part of a pyramid is exported.
    Since an image has no API that allows accessing the pyramid of which it
    is part, then there is no requirement to export the rest of the pyramid.


[[sec_creation]]
== Creation of Objects Upon Import

  * *2.2.1* To make it possible to implement certain scenarios, for example
    when an image needs to be created in a different way in the import
    environment than the export environment, certain objects may be created
    by the application and passed to the import routine.
    These objects need to be specified at the time of export, and provided
    again at the time of import.
  * *2.2.2* All other required objects will be created by the framework upon
    import.


[[sec_Imandexp]]
== Import and Export of Data Values For Objects To Be Created By The Framework

  * *2.3.1* Some objects may contain data values (as distinct from Meta
    Data) that require preservation across the export and import routines.
    The application can specify this at the time of export; those objects
    which are listed (by giving references) for export will then either be
    stripped of data values or have their data values entirely exported.
  * *2.3.2* For those objects which are *not* listed, the following rules
    apply:
  ** *2.3.2.1* In any one graph, if an object is not connected as an output
     parameter then its data values will be exported (and imported).
  ** *2.3.2.2* Where the object in (1) is a composite object such as a
     Pyramid or ObjectArray, then rule (1) applies to all sub-objects by
     definition.
  ** *2.3.2.3* Where the object in (1) is a sub-object such as a Region Of
     Interest or member of an ObjectArray, and the composite object does not
     meet the conditions of rule (1), then rule (1) applies to the
     sub-object only.
  ** *2.3.2.4* When objects are imported, the exported data values are
     assigned.
     However, if parts of the data were not defined at the time of export,
     then there is no guarantee that upon import the same values will be
     present.
     For example, consider an image where values had been written only to
     some (rectangular) part of the image before export.
     After import, only this part of the image will be guaranteed to contain
     the same values; those parts which were undefined before will be set to
     the default value for the data field.
     In the absence of any other definition the default value is zero.
  * *2.3.3* For those objects which *are* listed, then:
  ** *2.3.3.1* If the application requires, all defined values shall be
     exported.
  ** *2.3.3.2* The application requires, no values need be exported.
     The behavior here is as though no values had been defined (written) for
     the object.
  ** *2.3.3.3* Areas of undefined values will remain undefined (and possibly
     containing different random values) upon import.
  ** *2.3.3.4* All values are initialized upon import.
     If data was not defined, then it is set to the default value for the
     data field.
     In the absence of any other definition the default value is zero.


[[sec_createdapp]]
== Import and Export of Values For Objects To Be Created By The Application

  * *2.4.1* Objects created by the application before import of the binary
    object must have their data values defined by the application before the
    import operation.
  * *2.4.2* Sometimes changing the value stored in an object that is an
    input parameter of a verified graph will require that the graph is
    verified again before execution.
    If such an object is listed as to be supplied by the application, then
    the export operation will fail.


[[sec_IData]]
== Import and Export of Meta Data

  * *2.5.1* For all objects that are visible in the import, all query-able
    Meta Data must appear the same after import as before export.
  * *2.5.2* Objects created by the application before import and provided to
    the import API must match in type, size, etc.
    and therefore the export must export sufficient information for this
    check to be done.
  * *2.5.3* An Import may fail if the application-provided objects do not
    match those given at the time of export.
  * *2.5.4* Graphs with delays that are registered for auto-ageing at the
    time of export will be in the same condition after import of the
    objects.


[[sec_restrictions]]
== Restrictions Upon What References May Be Exported

  * *2.6.1* Export will fail if a `vx_context` is given in a list to export.
  * *2.6.2* Export will fail if a `<<vx_import>>` is given in a list to
    export.
    (`<<vx_import>>` is the type of the object returned by the import
    functions).
  * *2.6.3* Export will fail if a reference to a virtual object is given in
    the list to export.
  * *2.6.4* Export will fail if a `vx_node`, `vx_kernel`, or `vx_parameter`
    is given in the list to export.
  * *2.6.5* Export is otherwise defined for "`objects`" in the OpenVX 1.1
    specification.


[[sec_access]]
== Access To Object References In The Imported Object

  * *2.7.1* References are obtained from the import API for those objects
    whose references were listed at the time of export.
    These are not the same objects; they are equivalent objects created by
    the framework at import time.
    The implementation guarantees that references will be available and
    valid for all objects listed at the time of export, or the import will
    fail.
  * *2.7.2* References additionally may be obtained using a name given to an
    object before export.
  * *2.7.3* Before export, objects may be named for retrieval by name using
    the existing API
+
--
include::api/protos/vxSetReferenceName.txt[]
--
  * *2.7.4* Export will fail if duplicate names are found for listed
    references.
  * *2.7.5* Import will fail if duplicate names are found in the import
    object.
  * *2.7.6* If references are obtained by name, only those objects whose
    references were listed at the time of export can be found by name.
  * *2.7.7* A `vx_node`, `vx_kernel`, or `vx_parameter` cannot be obtained
    from the import object.

// Brief text:
Exports selected objects to memory in a vendor-specific format.

include::api/protos/vxExportObjectsToMemory.txt[]


// Detailed text:
A list of references in the given context is supplied to this function, and
all information required to re-create these is stored in memory in such a
way that those objects may be re-created with the corresponding import
function, according to the usage specified by the _uses_ parameter.

The information must be context independent in that it may be written to
external storage for later retreival with another instantiation of a
compatible implementation.

The list of objects to export may contain only valid references (i.e.
vxGetStatus() will return VX_SUCCESS) to `vx_graph` and non-virtual data
objects or the function will fail.
(Specifically not `vx_context`, `<<vx_import>>`, `vx_node`, `vx_kernel`,
`vx_parameter` or `vx_meta_format`)

Some node creation functions take C parameters rather than OpenVX data
objects (such as the _gradient_size_ parameter of `vxHarrisCornersNode` that
is provided as a `vx_int32`), because these are intended to be fixed at node
creation time; nevertheless OpenVX data objects may be assigned to them, for
example if the `vxCreateGenericNode` API is used.
A data object corresponding to a node parameter that is intended to be fixed
at node creation time must not be in the list of exported objects nor
attached as a graph parameter or the export operation will fail.

The _uses_ array specifies how the objects in the corresponding _refs_ array
will be exported.
A data object will always have its meta-data (e.g. dimensions and format of
an image) exported, and optionally may have its data (e.g. pixel values)
exported, and additionally you can decide whether the importing application
will create data objects to replace those attached to graphs, or if the
implementation will automatically create them.

[cols=".^3,.^6",options="header"]
|====
| Enumeration for _uses_ | Definition
| `<<VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE,VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE>>` | Export sufficient data to check that an application-supplied object is compatible when the data is later imported.
| `<<VX_IX_USE_EXPORT_VALUES,VX_IX_USE_EXPORT_VALUES>>` | Export complete information (for example image data or value of a scalar).
| `<<VX_IX_USE_NO_EXPORT_VALUES,VX_IX_USE_NO_EXPORT_VALUES>>` | Export meta-data only; the importing application will set values as applicable
|====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The `<<VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE,VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE>>` value must be given for
images created from handles, or the the export operation will fail.
====

The values in _uses_ are applicable only for data objects and are ignored
for `vx_graph` objects.

If the list _refs_ contains `vx_graph` objects, these graphs will be
verified during the export operation and the export operation will fail if
verification fails; when successfully exported graphs are subsequently
imported they will appear as verified.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The implementation may also choose to re-verify any previously verified
graphs and apply optimisations based upon which references are to be
exported and how.

Any data objects attached to a graph that are hidden, i.e. their references
are not in the list _refs_, may be treated by the implementation as virtual
objects, since they can never be visible when the graph is subsequently
imported.

Note that imported graphs cannot become unverified.
Attempts to change the graph that might normally cause the graph to be
unverified, e.g. calling vxSetGraphParameterByIndex with an object with
different metadata, will fail.

The implementation should make sure that all permissible changes of exported
objects are possible without re-verification.
For example:

  * A uniform image may be swapped for a non-uniform image, so corresponding
    optimisations should be inhibited if a uniform image appears in the
    _refs_ list
  * An image that is a region of interest of another image may be similarly
    replaced by any other image of matching size and format, and vice-versa
====

If a graph is exported that has delays registered for auto-aging, then this
information is also exported.

If the function is called with NULL for any of its parameters, this is an
error.

The reference counts of objects as visible to the calling application will
not be affected by calling this function.

The export operation will fail if more than one object whose reference is
listed at _refs_ has been given the same non-zero length name (via
`vxSetReferenceName`).

If a graph listed for export has any graph parameters not listed at _refs_,
then the export operation will fail.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The order of the references supplied in the _refs_ array will be the order
in which the framwork will supply references for the corresponding import
operation with `<<vxImportObjectsFromMemory>>`.

The same length of _uses_ array, containing the same values, and the same
value of _numrefs_, must be supplied for the corresponding import operation.
====

For objects not listed in _refs_, the following rules apply:

  . In any one graph, if an object is not connected as an output of a node
    in a graph being exported then its data values will be exported (for
    subsequent import).
  . Where the object in (1) is a composite object (such as a pyramid) then
    rule (1) applies to all of its sub-objects.
  . Where the object in (1) is a sub-object such as a region of interest,
    and the composite object (in this case the parent image) does not meet
    the conditions of rule (1), then rule (1) applies to the sub-object
    only.

*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _context_ - context from which to export objects, must be valid
.
  * `[in]` _numrefs_ - number of references to export.
  * `[in]` _refs_ - references to export.
    This is an array of length numrefs populated with the references to
    export.
  * `[in]` _uses_ - how to export the references.
    This is an array of length numrefs containing values as described
    above.
  * `[out]` _ptr_ - returns pointer to binary buffer.
    On error this is set to NULL.
  * `[out]` _length_ - number of bytes at *ptr.
    On error this is set to zero.

*Returns:* A `vx_status` value.

*Return Values*

  * `<<VX_SUCCESS,VX_SUCCESS>>` - If no errors occurred and the objects were
    sucessfully exported.
    An error is indicated when the return value is not VX_SUCCESS.

An implementation may provide several different return values to give useful
diagnostic information in the event of failure to export, but these are not
required to indicate possible recovery mechanisms, and for safety critical
use assume errors are not recoverable.

*Postcondition:* `<<vxReleaseExportedMemory>>` is used to deallocate the
memory.

*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _context_ - The context for which `<<vxExportObjectsToMemory>>` was
    called.
  * `[inout]` _ptr_ - A pointer previously set by calling
    `<<vxExportObjectsToMemory>>`.
    The function will fail if `*ptr` does not contain an address of memory
    previously allocated by `<<vxExportObjectsToMemory>>`.

*Postcondition:* After returning from sucessfully from this function *ptr is
set to NULL.

*Returns:* A `vx_status` value.

*Return Values*

  * `<<VX_SUCCESS,VX_SUCCESS>>` - If no errors occurred and the memory was sucessfully
    released.

An error is indicated when the return value is not VX_SUCCESS.

An implementation may provide several different return values to give useful

// Brief text:
Get a reference from the import object by name.

include::api/protos/vxGetImportReferenceByName.txt[]


// Detailed text:
All accessible references of the import object created using
`<<vxImportObjectsFromMemory>>` are in the array _refs_, which is populated
partly by the application before import, and partly by the framework.
However, it may be more convenient to access the references in the import
object without referring to this array, for example if the import object is
passed as a parameter to another function.
In this case, references may be retreived by name, assuming that
`vxSetReferenceName` was called to assign a name to the reference.
This function searches the given import for the given name and returns the
associated reference.

The reference may have been named either before export or after
import.

If more than one reference exists in the import with the given name, this is
an error.

Only references in the array _refs_ after calling
`<<vxImportObjectsFromMemory>>` may be retrieved using this function.

A reference to a named object may be obtained from a valid import object
using this API even if all other references to the object have been
released.

*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _import_ - The import object in which to find the name; the
    function will fail if this parameter is not valid.
  * `[in]` _name_ - The name to find, points to a string of at least one and
    less than VX_MAX_REFERENCE_NAME bytes followed by a zero byte; the
    function will fail if this is not valid.

*Returns:* A `vx_reference`.

Calling `vxGetStatus` with the reference as a parameter will return
VX_SUCCESS if the function was successful.
:
Another value is given to indicate that there was an error.

On success, the reference count of the object in question is
incremented.

An implementation may provide several different error codes to give useful
diagnostic information in the event of failure to retrieve a reference, but
these are not required to indicate possibly recovery mechanisms, and for
safety critical use assume errors are not recoverable.

*Precondition:* `vxSetReferenceName` was used to name the reference.

*Postcondition:* use `ref vxReleaseReference` or appropriate specific
release function to release a reference obtained by this method.
// end::refpage:vxGetImportReferenceByName[]

// tag::refpage:vxImportObjectsFromMemory[]
// [desc='',type='protos']
==== vxImportObjectsFromMemory

// Brief text:
Imports objects into a context from a vendor-specific format in memory.

include::api/protos/vxImportObjectsFromMemory.txt[]


// Detailed text:
This function imports objects from a memory blob previously created using
`<<vxExportObjectsToMemory>>`.

A pointer to memory is given where a list of references is stored, together
with the list of uses which describes how the references are used.
The number of references given and the list of uses must match that given
upon export, or this function will not be sucessful.

The _uses_ array specifies how the objects in the corresponding _refs_ array
will be imported:

[cols=".^3,.^6"]
|====
| `<<VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE,VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE>>` | The application must create the object and supply the reference; the meta-data of the object must match exactly the meta-data of the object when it was exported, except that the name need not match.  If the supplied reference has a different name to that stored, the supplied name is used.
| `<<VX_IX_USE_EXPORT_VALUES,VX_IX_USE_EXPORT_VALUES>>` | The implementation will create the object and set the data in it. Any data not defined at the time of export of the object will be set to a default value (zero in the absence of any other definition) upon import.
| `<<VX_IX_USE_NO_EXPORT_VALUES,VX_IX_USE_NO_EXPORT_VALUES>>` | The implementation will create the object and the importing application will set values as applicable.
|====

References are obtained from the import API for those objects whose
references were listed at the time of export.
These are not the same objects; they are equivalent objects created by the
framework at import time.
The implementation guarantees that references will be available and valid
for all objects listed at the time of export, or the import will
fail.

The import operation will fail if more than one object whose reference is
listed at _refs_ has been given the same non-zero length name (via
`vxSetReferenceName`).

The import will be unsuccessful if any of the parameters supplied is
NULL.

After completion of the function the memory at _ptr_ may be deallocated by
the application as it will not be used by any of the created objects.

Any delays imported with graphs for which they are registered for auto-aging
remain registered for auto-aging.

After import, a graph must execute with exactly the same effect with respect
to its visible parameters as before export.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The _refs_ array must be the correct length to hold all references of the
import; this will be the same length that was supplied at the time of
export.
Only references for objects created by the application, where the
corresponding _uses_ entry is `<<VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE,VX_IX_USE_APPLICATION_CREATE>>` should be
filled in by the application; all other entries will be supplied by the
framework and may be initialised by the application to NULL.
The _uses_ array must have the identical length and content as given at the
time of export, and the value of _numrefs_ must also match; these measures
increase confidence that the import contains the correct data.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Graph parameters may be changed after import by using the
`vxSetGraphParameterByIndex` API, and images may also be changed by using
the `vxSwapImageHandle` API.
When `vxSetGraphParameterByIndex` is used, the framework will check that the
new parameter is of the correct type to run with the graph, which cannot be
re-verified.
If the reference supplied is not suitable, an error will be returned, but
there may be circumstances where changing graph parameters for unsuitable
ones is not detected and could lead to implementation-dependent behaviour;
one such circumstance is when the new parameters are images corresponding to
overlapping regions of interest.
The user should avoid these circumstances.
In other words,

  * The meta data of the new graph parameter must match the meta data of the
    graph parameter it replaces.
  * A graph parameter must not be NULL.
====

*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _context_ - context into which to import objects, must be valid
  * `[in]` _numrefs_ - number of references to import, must match export
  * `[inout]` _refs_ - references imported or application-created data which must match meta-data of the export
  * `[in]` _uses_ - how to import the references, must match export values
  * `[in]` _ptr_ - pointer to binary buffer containing a valid binary export
  * `[in]` _length_ - number of bytes at *ptr, i.e. the length of the export

*Returns:* A `<<vx_import>>`.
Calling `vxGetStatus` with the `vx_import` as a parameter will return
VX_SUCCESS if the function was successful.

Another value is given to indicate that there was an error.

An implementation may provide several different error codes to give useful
diagnostic information in the event of failure to import objects, but these
are not required to indicate possibly recovery mechanisms, and for safety
critical use assume errors are not recoverable.

*Postcondition:* `<<vxReleaseImport>>` is used to release the import object.

*Postcondition:* Use `vxReleaseReference` or an appropriate specific release
function to release the references in the array refs when they are no longer
required.
