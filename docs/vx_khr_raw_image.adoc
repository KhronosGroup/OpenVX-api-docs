[[raw_image,Raw Image Extension]] This extension is intended to add Raw Image support to the vx_image object in OpenVX.

[[sec_scope]]
== In Scope
In the context of this extension, a "raw image" contains the readout of camera sensors which output pre-processed "raw" images, including,
but not limited to, Bayer sensor readouts. The raw image data type, for example, may be used as an output parameter of a custom camera capture OpenVX
source node.

This extension is focused on specifying the minimal set of attributes required to store/access a variety of known sensor readout information in memory.
The following features were included to accommodate known readout types across a variety of raw image sensors commonly used in the industry:

* *Multi-exposure readout* - There is a class of wide dynamic range (WDR) sensors that support multiple exposures per timestamp.  Some of these sensors
read out each exposure on different CSI Virtual Channels, and others read out all exposures in a single CSI Virtual Channel in interleaved fashion. Data access APIs like
"map" and "copy" allow the user to access data from a specific exposure while abstracting if the data was interleaved or not during read out.
  ** *Separate CSI Virtual Channels* - When each exposure is read out on separate CSI Virtual Channels, then each exposure can be stored in memory in separate planes.
  Additionally, this mode enables each exposure to be stored as a different bit width (e.g. 16+12 mode).
  ** *Single CSI Virtual Channel* - When all exposures are read out in a single CSI Virtual Channel, they are read out in either a line interleaved or pixel interleaved
  fashion, requiring all exposures to be stored accordingly in memory in a single buffer. The raw image object has a parameter that can be set to indicate the interleaved
  format of the readout of these exposures.

* *Meta Data* - Several sensor vendors offer various, vendor-specific meta information that is read out either before, or after, the pixel data. This meta
data may contain side-band information such as histograms or statistics that may be used by auto exposure or auto white balance algorithms running on the
application processor.  The image data type created for raw images, therefore, can be configured with programmable number of lines of meta data before, and/or after, the pixel data.
Data access APIs like "map" and "copy" allow the user to access the pixel data, or the meta data, accordingly.

[[sec_outscope]]
== Not in Scope
This extension does NOT specify any new kernels, nor does it specify which existing OpenVX vision kernels are expected to support raw images.  These details shall be defined by
specific implementations at this time.

[[page_design]]
= Design Overview
Instead of creating a new data type for raw images, this extension primarily extends the existing `<<vx_image>>` data type.  Most of the existing image data object
functions can be reused with minor extensions (outlined below), however it does require a new 'create' function to create images of raw format type, where additional
information should be passed from new types and enum definitions.

[[sec_changes]]
== Changes to the OpenVX Specification
This section outlines the new functions, extensions to existing functions, and other changes to the OpenVX Specification included in this extension.


[[new_functions]]
=== New Functions
There are only three new functions added as part of this extension:

  * `<<vxCreateRawImage>>`
  * `<<vxCreateVirtualRawImage>>`
  * `<<vxCopyImagePatchWithFlags>>`

One of the two create functions should be used to create a `<<vx_image>>` object that contains raw image data instead of using the existing image create functions.

The new copy function is meant to be a generic extension to the main spec, since the original copy image function does not have the 'flags' parameter like the image map
function does.  This 'flags' parameter is a generic extension field that is needed by this extension, so we are defining this new copy image function here for consideration
as part of a future version of the main specification.

The API details of these functions, along with associated new data structures are found in the <<module_documentation>>
section.

[[extended_functions]]
=== Extended Functions
This section clarifies how to use the following `<<vx_image>>` functions with raw images:

  * `<<vxQueryImage>>`
  * `<<vxMapImagePatch>>`
  * `<<vxCopyImagePatchWithFlags>>`

[[query_function]]
==== vxQueryImage
The `<<vxQueryImage>>` function can be used with the following new attribute definitions added to support raw images:

  * `<<VX_IMAGE_IS_RAW>>`
  * `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_EXPOSURE_INTERLEAVING>>`
  * `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_FORMAT>>`
  * `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_META_HEIGHT_BEFORE>>`
  * `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_META_HEIGHT_AFTER>>`

Generally, if the application is not sure if a `<<vx_image>>` object contains a raw image, it can query the `<<vx_image>>` using the `<<VX_IMAGE_IS_RAW>>`
definition.  If the query returns `<<vx_true_e>>`, then the other raw image attributes can also be queried.

The following table lists which attributes are valid for raw images, and which attributes are valid for all other images from the main specification.

[options="header"]
|====
| Attribute                                 |  Main Spec Images |  Raw Images  |  Comments for Raw Images
| `<<VX_IMAGE_IS_RAW>>`                     |        valid      |   valid      | Returns `<<vx_true_e>>`
| `<<VX_IMAGE_WIDTH>>`                      |        valid      |   valid      |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_HEIGHT>>`                     |        valid      |   valid      |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_FORMAT>>`                     |        valid      |   valid      | Returns `<<VX_DF_IMAGE_RAW>>`
| `<<VX_IMAGE_PLANES>>`                     |        valid      |   valid      | Returns number of exposures
| `<<VX_IMAGE_SPACE>>`                      |        valid      |   valid      | Returns `<<VX_COLOR_SPACE_NONE>>`
| `<<VX_IMAGE_RANGE>>`                      |        valid      |              |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_MEMORY_TYPE>>`                |        valid      |   valid      | Returns `<<VX_MEMORY_TYPE_NONE>>`
| `<<VX_IMAGE_IS_UNIFORM>>`                 |        valid      |   valid      | Returns `<<vx_false_e>>`
| `<<VX_IMAGE_UNIFORM_VALUE>>`              |        valid      |              |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_EXPOSURE_INTERLEAVING>>`  |                   |   valid      |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_FORMAT>>`                 |                   |   valid      |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_META_HEIGHT_BEFORE>>`     |                   |   valid      |
| `<<VX_IMAGE_RAW_META_HEIGHT_AFTER>>`      |                   |   valid      |
|====

NOTE: If a query is made using an attribute which is not valid for the type of image as indicated in the table above, then a VX_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED error
shall be returned.

[[Map_function]]
==== vxMapImagePatch
The `<<vxMapImagePatch>>` function can be used with the following extensions:

  * The 'plane_index' parameter can refer to the exposure_index of the raw image.
  * The flags parameter shall be set to one of the values from the new `<<vx_image_raw_buffer_access_e>>` enumeration to specify
    which buffer within the raw image to map.

[[Copy_function]]
==== vxCopyImagePatchWithFlags
This extension relies on
The `<<vxCopyImagePatchWithFlags>>` function can be used with the following extensions:

  * The 'image_plane_index' parameter can refer to the exposure_index of the raw image.
  * The flags parameter shall be set to one of the values from the new `<<vx_image_raw_buffer_access_e>>` enumeration to specify
    which buffer within the raw image to map.

[[sec_code]]
== Example Code
This section demonstrates the usage of the new APIs in example code.

[[sec_create]]
=== Create and Release
The following example shows how the Raw Image create API could be used to connect two custom user kernels together in a graph. The example also defines
a data structure used within the raw image: user_custom_data_t.

[source,cpp]
----
/*
 * Utility API used to create the graph below using raw image in between two
 * user defined nodes:
 *
 * The following graph is created,
 * vxRawSensorCaptureNode -> TMP_RAW_IMAGE -> vxRawProcessingNode -> VX_IMAGE
 *
 */
static vx_graph create_graph(vx_context context,
                             vx_enum raw_image_sensor_id)
{
    vx_graph graph;
    vx_node n0, n1;
    vx_image imgYuv;
    vx_image tmp_raw_image_obj;
    vx_user_data_object tuning_user_obj;
    vx_image_raw_create_params_t create_params;
    user_tuning_params_t tuning_params;

    graph = vxCreateGraph(context);

    /* Initialize create_params data structure from sensor driver */
    sensor_get_raw_create_params(raw_image_sensor_id, &create_params);

    /* create intermediate custom raw image object */
    tmp_raw_image_obj = vxCreateRawImage(context,
                                         &create_params,
                                         sizeof(vx_image_raw_create_params_t));

    /* create first node: This is a source node connected to the capture driver on
     * csi interface. output is an image object containing raw data */
    n0 = userRawSensorCaptureNode(graph, tmp_raw_image_obj);



    /* Initialize raw processing tuning parameters from sensor driver */
    sensor_get_tuning_params(raw_image_sensor_id, &tuning_params);

    /* create tuning parameters user data object to send as input to the
     * raw processing node */
    tuning_user_obj = vxCreateUserDataObject(context,
                                      "user_tuning_params_t",
                                      sizeof(user_tuning_params_t),
                                      &tuning_params);

    /* create output image object */
    imgYuv = vxCreateImage(context, create_params.width, create_params.height, VX_DF_IMAGE_YUYV);

    /* create second node: inputs are output of first node and tuning parameters,
     * output is yuv image */
    n1 = userRawProcessingNode(graph, tmp_raw_image_obj, tuning_user_obj, imgYuv);

    vxReleaseNode(&n0);
    vxReleaseNode(&n1);
    vxReleaseImage(&tmp_raw_image_obj);
    vxReleaseImage(&imgYuv);
    vxReleaseUserDataObject(&tuning_user_obj);

    return graph;
}
----

[[sec_query]]
=== Query and Map/Unmap or Copy
The map/unmap and copy functions operate in a manner almost identical to the OpenVX specification
`<<vx_image>>` functions, so those can be used more or less as a reference.  The main difference is that
the user can specify which exposure to access in the 'plane_index' paramter; and the user can also specify
which type of data to access (pixel data, or meta data) as part of the 'flags' parameter.

*Returns:* An image reference `<<vx_image>>`.
Any possible errors preventing a successful creation should be checked using `<<vxGetStatus>>`

// Detailed text:
*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _image_ - The reference to the image object that is the source or
    the destination of the copy.
  * `[in]` _image_rect_ - The coordinates of the image patch.
    The patch must be within the bounds of the image.
    (_start_x_, _start_y_) gives the coordinates of the topleft pixel inside
    the patch, while (_end_x_, _end_y_) gives the coordinates of the
    bottomright element out of the patch.
    Must be 0 {leq} start < end {leq} number of pixels in the image
    dimension.
  * `[in]` _image_plane_index_ - The plane index of the image object that is
    the source or the destination of the patch copy.
  * `[in]` _user_addr_ - The address of a structure describing the layout of
    the user memory location pointed by user_ptr.
    In the structure, only _dim_x_, _dim_y_, _stride_x_ and _stride_y_
    fields must be provided, other fields are ignored by the function.
    The layout of the user memory must follow a row major order: _stride_x_
    = pixel size in bytes, and _stride_y_ {geq} _stride_x_ * _dim_x_ .
  * `[in]` _user_ptr_ - The address of the memory location where to store
    the requested data if the copy was requested in read mode, or from where
    to get the data to store into the image object if the copy was requested
    in write mode.
    The accessible memory must be large enough to contain the specified
    patch with the specified layout: accessible memory in bytes {geq}
    (_end_y_ - _start_y_) * _stride_y_.
  * `[in]` _usage_ - This declares the effect of the copy with regard to the
    image object using the `<<vx_accessor_e>>` enumeration.
    For uniform images, only `<<VX_READ_ONLY,VX_READ_ONLY>>` is supported.
    For other images, only `<<VX_READ_ONLY,VX_READ_ONLY>>` and `<<VX_WRITE_ONLY,VX_WRITE_ONLY>>` are
    supported:
  ** `<<VX_READ_ONLY,VX_READ_ONLY>>` means that data is copied from the image object into
     the application memory.
  ** `<<VX_WRITE_ONLY,VX_WRITE_ONLY>>` means that data is copied into the image object
     from the application memory.
  * `[in]` _user_mem_type_ - A `<<vx_memory_type_e>>` enumeration that
    specifies the memory type of the memory referenced by the user_addr.
  * `[in]` _flags_ - An integer that allows passing options to the copy
    operation.

*Returns:* A `<<vx_status_e>>` enumeration.

*Return Values*

  * `<<VX_SUCCESS,VX_SUCCESS>>` - No errors; any other value indicates failure.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_OPTIMIZED_AWAY,VX_ERROR_OPTIMIZED_AWAY>>` - This is a reference to a virtual image
    that cannot be accessed by the application.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE,VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE>>` - image is not a valid `<<vx_image>>`
    reference.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS,VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS>>` - An other parameter is incorrect.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_NO_MEMORY,VX_ERROR_NO_MEMORY>>` - Internal memory allocation failed.

[NOTE]

====
If the application asks for data outside the valid region, the returned values
are implementation-defined.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
When copying data from/to `<<VX_DF_IMAGE_U1,VX_DF_IMAGE_U1>>` images the bit offsets for pixels are
preserved. It's not necessary for the coordinates of the image patch to start and end at byte
boundaries. In that case, when copying data _to_ an image only the pixels inside the specified image
patch will be written to and when copying _from_ an image the resulting padding pixels at the start
and/or end of the patch are implementation-defined.
