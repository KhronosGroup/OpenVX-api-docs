[[sec_overview]]
= Extension Specification

This extension is intended to define the subset of behaviors and data types
of the signed 16-bit support for OpenVX^(TM)^.


[[sec_changes]]
== Changes to the OpenVX 1.1 Specification

The S16 extension enhances the input and output types per each kernel
defined in the OpenVX 1.1 standard.
The table below indicates the changes to each kernel for input and output.

Input and output argument types should be the same (e.g. input S16 and
output S16) unless stated otherwise in the function description.
In cases where having S16 inputs could lead to the overflow of S16 outputs,
the behavior is analogous to what is currently in the standard for when the
inputs are U8.

In the main standard, where the input is U8 and the output is also U8, then
the output is converted according to the overflow policy in the function
definition.
Analogously, for this extension, where the inputs and outputs are both S16,
the output is converted as necessary according to the overflow policy in the
function definition.

In the main standard, where the input can be U8 and the output S16, the
zero-extended answer is just written into the output.
Analogously, for this extension, where the input can be S16 and the output
S32, the sign-bit-extended result is written to the output.

[[sec_s16_kernels]]
== Vision Functions

The following sections describe additional changes and clarifications to
existing kernel definitions beyond those already described in sections
<<sec_s16_inputs>> and <<sec_s16_outputs>>.


[[sec_s16_bitwise]]
=== Bitwise Operations

Referring to: AND, EXCLUSIVE OR, INCLUSIVE OR, and NOT.

All bit-wise operations on signed operands are executed in twos-complement
representation of the values.


[[sec_s16_convolve]]
=== Custom Convolution

The current spec says if the input type is U8 and the output type is S16,
then the output is simply the sum/scale.
However, if the output type is U8, then the output saturates on both ends: 0
if sum/scale < 0, and 255 if sum/scale > 255.
Analogously, S16 outputs should saturate to -32768 if sum/scale < -32768,
and 32767 if sum/scale > 32767, and just sum/scale otherwise.

For `VX_DF_IMAGE_S16` output, an additional step is taken:
[latexmath]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
output(x,y) =
    \begin{cases}
        -32768      & \text{if } sum / scale < -32768 \\
        32767       & \text{if } sum / scale > 32767 \\
        sum / scale & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For `VX_DF_IMAGE_S32` output, the summation is simply set to the output

  :: [eq]#output(x,y) = sum / scale#


[[sec_s16_fast]]
=== Fast Corners

When the input image is of type `VX_DF_IMAGE_S16`, the value of the
intensity difference threshold _strength_thresh_.
of type `VX_TYPE_FLOAT32` must be within:

  :: [eq]#`UINT16_MIN` < t < `UINT16_MAX`#
