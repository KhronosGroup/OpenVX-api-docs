[[user_data_object,User Data Object Extension]] This extension is intended to define the new User Data Object support for OpenVX. 
This data object is intended to offer a standard mechanism
to enable user kernels with a data object parameter which is not natively supported by existing data objects in the OpenVX spec.

[[sec_background]]
== Background
To set the stage for the describing the problem that
user data objects solve, the following is a brief list of relevant points from the current specification:

.*Data Objects*
- OpenVX contains several, specific, built-in data objects (`<<vx_image>>`, `<<vx_array>>`, etc),
  but no explicit means for user to extend to use their own custom data types as data objects used for node parameters.

.*User structs*
- User structs were originally created to handle the use of additional fixed-size data structure types needed by `<<vx_array>>` for user kernels.
- The model for such structures were taken from existing data structures like `<<vx_keypoints_t>>` or `<<vx_coordinates_t>>`,
  which are simple, fixed-sized, data structures which could appear as a list contained in a `<<vx_array>>`.
- In OpenVX 1.2, the scope of user structs was expanded to `<<vx_scalar>>`, which was meant to handle a single instance of a data structure as opposed to an array of them.
- The function `<<vxRegisterUserStruct>>` simply informed the framework that it needed a `<<vx_enum>>` which would be associated with a fixed buffer size to house the user struct.
  This enum was needed as a backward-compatible way to create an array or scalar using this type, as the create functions require passing a type enum as an argument in order to
  properly allocate enough memory for each element in the array. 
- The user kernel has no way to know which specific data structure this enum is assigned to since it is assigned at run-time.  The most it can determine is the size of the structure.
  This can be indirectly used to determine which user structure was passed to the user kernel assuming all user structures are different sizes.  However, if two or more different 
  user structs have the same size, then the user structure can't be sure which one was passed.

[[sec_problem]]
=== Limitations in Existing Specification
If a user kernel wants to use a new, custom, data object that is not already included in OpenVX, there is currently no mechanism to extend OpenVX framework to do this.
The closest mechanism available within the existing specification is "user structs" which can be used with `<<vx_array>>` or `<<vx_scalar>>`. However, there are at least 3 limitations
of user structs that make it less than ideal for use as a custom user kernel node parameter data object:

.*Static Size*
 - The existing mechanism for user struct assumes a fixed size, and does not directly support a variable size. The data structure of a particular
   type of custom object may have a variable size, similar to an `<<vx_image>>` type.  The image size changes depending on the width and height parameters.
 - There are two possible workarounds for this:
   . Call `<<vxRegisterUserStruct>>` for each instance of the data structure which has a different size.
     *** This can result in a prohibitively high number of user structs which need to be registered and maintained, even though many of them are different sizes of the same type
   . Call `<<vxRegisterUserStruct>>` using the worst-case memory requirement
     *** This can result in a prohibitively large waste of memory, which is further limited in embedded applications.

.*Memory Access Performance*
 - If using `<<vx_scalar>>`, there is no Map/Unmap, only Copy
   * For large data objects, a copy may reduce performance each time the application needs to access data.
 - If using `<<vx_array>>`, there is at least Map/Unmap, but the whole data object needs to be mapped/unmapped as there is no granularity of a range within a user struct.
   * If the application only needs to access a small part of the object, mapping the entire object may also reduce performance.

.*Misnomer*
  - Using `<<vx_scalar>>` to contain a custom object represented by a complex data structure is a misnomer and a bit confusing.

[[page_design]]
= Design Overview
The new APIs added in this extension for supporting user data objects follow the same pattern as existing Data Object APIs in OpenVX (i.e. create, release, query, copy, map, and unmap).

[[sec_code]]
== Example Code
This section demonstrates the usage of the new APIs in example code.

[[sec_create]]
=== Create and Release
The following example shows how the User Data Object create and release APIs could be used to connect two custom user kernels together in a graph. The example also defines
a data structure used within the user data object: user_custom_data_t.

[source,cpp]
----
/*
 * The custom data object structure for a user custom kernel which contains 
 * a custom object of 2 images with embedded metadata (as an example).

                                    (so kernel knows how to parse) */
    uint16_t  source_data;     /*!< Indicates the source data corresponding
                                    to this data (for algorithm usage) */
    uint16_t  byte_size[2];    /*!< Number of bytes per pixel of each image
                                    in payload */
    uint16_t  width[2];        /*!< Widths of each image in payload */
    uint16_t  heights[2];      /*!< Heights of each image in payload */
    uint16_t  meta_size[2];    /*!< Number of bytes of meta information for
                                    each image in payload */

    /* create first node: input is 2 images and source string, output is combined
     * images data object with mode, source information, and meta information added
     * in custom format for downstream processing on second node */

    class = 0;

	if(strncmp(obj_name, "user_custom_data_t", VX_MAX_REFERENCE_NAME) == 0)
	{
		vx_size offset = offsetof(user_custom_data_t, source_data);

  ** `<<VX_READ_ONLY,VX_READ_ONLY>>`: after the function call, the content of the memory
     location pointed by (*_ptr_) contains the user data object subset data.
     Writing into this memory location is forbidden and its behavior is implementation specific.
  ** `<<VX_READ_AND_WRITE,VX_READ_AND_WRITE>>`: after the function call, the content of the
     memory location pointed by (*_ptr_) contains the user data object subset data;
     writing into this memory is allowed only for the location of items and
     will result in a modification of the affected items in the user data object
     once the range is unmapped.
  ** `<<VX_WRITE_ONLY,VX_WRITE_ONLY>>`: after the function call, the memory location pointed by (*_ptr_)
     contains implementation specific data; writing to all data in the subset is required prior to
     unmapping. Data values not written by the application before unmap may be defined differently in
     different implementations after unmap, even if they were well defined before map.
  * `[in]` _mem_type_ - A `<<vx_memory_type_e>>` enumeration that specifies
    the type of the memory where the user data object subset is requested to be mapped.
  * `[in]` _flags_ - An integer that allows passing options to the map
    operation.
    Use the `<<vx_map_flag_e>>` enumeration.

*Returns:* A `<<vx_status_e>>` enumeration.

*Return Values*

  * `<<VX_SUCCESS,VX_SUCCESS>>` - No errors; any other value indicates failure.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_OPTIMIZED_AWAY,VX_ERROR_OPTIMIZED_AWAY>>` - This is a reference to a virtual user data object
    that cannot be accessed by the application.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE,VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE>>` -  _user_data_object_ is not a valid `<<vx_user_data_object>>`
    reference.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS,VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS>>` - An other parameter is incorrect.

*Postcondition:* `<<vxUnmapUserDataObject>>` with same (*map_id) value.

=== vxUnmapUserDataObject
indexterm:[User Data Object API, vxUnmapUserDataObject]
// Brief text:
Unmap and commit potential changes to a user data object subset that was previously mapped.
Unmapping a user data object subset invalidates the memory location from which the subset could
be accessed by the application. Accessing this memory location after the unmap function
completes is implementation specific.

// Detailed text:
*Parameters*

  * `[in]` _user_data_object_ - The reference to the user data object to unmap.
  * `[out]` _map_id_ - The unique map identifier that was returned when
    calling `<<vxMapUserDataObject>>`.

*Returns:* A `<<vx_status_e>>` enumeration.

*Return Values*

  * `<<VX_SUCCESS,VX_SUCCESS>>` - No errors; any other value indicates failure.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE,VX_ERROR_INVALID_REFERENCE>>` - The _user_data_object_ reference is not actually a `<<vx_user_data_object>>`
    reference.
  * `<<VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS,VX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS>>` - An other parameter is incorrect.

*Precondition:* `<<vxMapUserDataObject>>` returning the same map_id value
